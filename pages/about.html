         <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p class = "p" id = "myP"> My name is Yusuf, and I'm an aspiring Electrical Engineer with experience in both iOS and Android app development, web development, digital electronics, and leading teams in projects (which my presidencies in my high school's Architecture Construction Engineering (ACE) and Leadership clubs have taught me). I also have some research experience from the Young Engineer Experience (YEE) that I experienced in the first half of the summer of 2019 in SDSU. In addition, a week-long engineering summer camp in Sacramento (CREATE) that I took subsequent to my research experience helped me learn several other applications of electrical engineering when I toured and visited many architecture firms and construction sites all over northern California.</p>
            
            <p class = "p" id = "myP"> My main hobbies include Android and iOS app development, photography, web-development, and poetry. To view some of the pictures that I took in places like Phoenix and Cairo, click here: <a class = "blue" href = "photos.html">Photos</a></p>
